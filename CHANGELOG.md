## [1.7.3] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **Server no longer reports a stale version to clients.** `SERVER_VERSION` was hardcoded to `1.6.3` and had not been updated for three releases, so every client saw `1.6.3` in the `initialize` response regardless of the version actually running. It is now read from `package.json` at startup, which cannot drift. Falls back to `0.0.0-unknown` with a diagnostic on stderr if the file is unreadable, rather than failing startup.
- **`server.json` no longer drifts from the released version.** The MCP registry manifest was also stuck at `1.6.3`, in both its top-level `version` and its npm package entry. Because it is plain JSON it cannot read `package.json` at runtime, so it is now rewritten at bump time by `scripts/sync-server-json.mjs`, wired into the npm `version` lifecycle script. Running `npm version patch|minor|major` keeps the manifest in step automatically.

### Documentation
- Documented `sonarr_refresh_series` and `radarr_refresh_movie` in the README tool tables. Both shipped in 1.6.1 (via [#9](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/9)) but were never listed, leaving 43 of 45 tools documented.

### Security
- Bumped `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from 1.29.0 to **1.30.0** and refreshed `package-lock.json` to clear seven Dependabot advisories in transitive dependencies. All were pulled in via the SDK; none are direct dependencies of this project, and none are reachable from the code paths this server uses (it imports only `Server`, `StdioServerTransport` and `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`, and builds its own listener on `node:http`). The lockfile still matters because the Docker image installs with `npm ci`.
  - `fast-uri` 3.1.2 → **3.1.4** (via `ajv`) — host confusion via literal backslash authority delimiter (GHSA-v2hh-gcrm-f6hx, high) and via failed IDN canonicalization (GHSA-4c8g-83qw-93j6, high).
  - `hono` 4.12.26 → **4.12.32** — server-side XSS via JSX escaping bypass in `cx()` (GHSA-w62v-xxxg-mg59), `hono/jsx` cross-request context disclosure (GHSA-hvrm-45r6-mjfj), and API Gateway v1 adapter dropping a repeated request header during de-duplication (GHSA-xgm2-5f3f-mvvc). This server uses no JSX and no Lambda adapter.
  - `@hono/node-server` 1.19.14 → **2.0.12** — `serve-static` path traversal on Windows via encoded backslash `%5C` (GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9). Required the SDK bump: 1.29.0 pinned `^1.19.9`, which cannot reach the patched 2.0.5; 1.30.0 widens the range to `^1.19.9 || ^2.0.5`. This server does not use `serve-static`.
  - `body-parser` 2.2.2 → **2.3.0** (via `express`) — denial of service when an invalid limit value silently disables size enforcement (GHSA-v422-hmwv-36x6). This server does not use Express.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **HTTP transport no longer deadlocks behind a gateway/proxy** ([#22](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/22), by [@rwlove](https://github.com/rwlove); fixes [#21](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/issues/21)). The previous implementation shared a single module-level `Server` and serialized every request through a queue, because one `Server` can only be connected to one transport at a time. The moment a streamable-HTTP client (e.g. an MCP gateway/proxy such as n8n) opened its long-lived `GET` SSE stream, that request never completed and blocked the queue permanently — every subsequent `POST` (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, …) hung with no response. The transport now builds a **fresh `Server` + `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` per request** (the SDK's documented stateless pattern) and tears them down on response close, so a long-lived stream can no longer block other requests. The stdio transport is unchanged. Verified: with a GET stream held open, a concurrent POST went from timing out at 8 s to returning in ~2 ms.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-30

### Security
- Bumped `hono` from 4.12.22 to **4.12.26** ([#26](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/26)) to clear five advisories affecting `hono <= 4.12.24`: CORS middleware reflecting any origin with credentials (GHSA-88fw-hqm2-52qc), `serve-static` path traversal via encoded backslash on Windows (GHSA-wwfh-h76j-fc44), body-limit bypass on AWS Lambda (GHSA-rv63-4mwf-qqc2), and `Set-Cookie` / repeated-header dropping in the Lambda adapters (GHSA-j6c9-x7qj-28xf, GHSA-wgpf-jwqj-8h8p). Thanks to [@acesplit](https://github.com/acesplit) (#25) for the early report.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Radarr feature expansion** ([#12](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/12), by [@rappo](https://github.com/rappo)):
  - `radarr_update_movie` — update an existing movie's monitored state, quality profile, and other editable fields
  - `radarr_search_movies` — bulk-trigger searches across multiple movies at once
  - `radarr_delete_queue_item` — remove a stuck or unwanted item from the Radarr download queue
  - Quality-profile and quality fields surfaced on movie responses
- **Tag-triggered release pipeline** ([#20](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/20), based on [#11](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/11) by [@alejandrosnz](https://github.com/alejandrosnz)):
  - Multi-arch Docker images (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) built and pushed to **GHCR** on every `vX.Y.Z` tag, tagged `latest` / major / minor / exact
  - GitHub Release created automatically with notes pulled from this CHANGELOG
  - Hardened: every action pinned to a commit SHA, `workflow_dispatch` inputs passed via env vars, per-job least-privilege permissions, strict semver + package.json + CHANGELOG validation guards
  - **No npm publish and no stored `NPM_TOKEN`** — the pipeline uses only the per-run, auto-expiring `GITHUB_TOKEN`. npm publishing stays manual and passkey-gated.
- **`docker-compose.yml`** for self-hosters (n8n etc.) to run the server in HTTP mode in one command. Note: the compose HTTP endpoint is unauthenticated — intended for LAN / behind a reverse proxy only. Addresses the public-image request in [#5](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/issues/5).

## [1.6.5] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- HTTP transport now runs in **stateless mode** — a fresh `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` per request with no `Mcp-Session-Id` issued — fixing `400 Bad Request: Mcp-Session-Id header is required` for MCP clients that do not echo the session header back (notably **Claude Code**). The stateful implementation in 1.6.3/1.6.4 only worked for clients that round-tripped the session id. Request handling is serialized so the shared server is only ever connected to one transport at a time, and a fresh transport per request still sidesteps the SDK 1.27.x stateless-reuse guard. Added a regression test that exercises the no-session-header path. Thanks to [@jakefriz](https://github.com/jakefriz) (#15) and [@alejandrosnz](https://github.com/alejandrosnz) (#11) for independently identifying the stateless fix.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-06-10

### Security
- Bumped `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `^1.29.0` to clear transitive CVEs in nested dependencies

### Note
- Supersedes the never-published-to-npm 1.6.3 (which was tagged but not released); 1.6.4 includes all 1.6.3 changes plus the dependency security update.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- Fixed remote HTTP MCP mode failing after initialization with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.27.x by enabling stateful HTTP sessions with generated MCP session IDs (#5, reported by [@michaelheyman](https://github.com/michaelheyman))

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Upgraded `hono` and `path-to-regexp` to resolve 1 high and 2 moderate severity vulnerabilities (cookie name handling, path traversal in `toSSG`, static-serve middleware bypass, JSX SSR injection, IPv6 matching in `ipRestriction`, and ReDoS in `path-to-regexp`)

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Remote HTTP MCP mode via `MCP_TRANSPORT=http` (with `HOST`, `PORT`, `MCP_PATH` env vars)
- Generic `search` and `fetch` tools for hosted/remote MCP clients (e.g. ChatGPT connectors)
- Docker usage examples in the README for both stdio and HTTP mode
- `limit` / `offset` pagination for:
  - `sonarr_get_queue`
  - `radarr_get_queue`
  - `lidarr_get_queue`
- `sonarr_refresh_series` and `radarr_refresh_movie` tools for triggering targeted metadata refresh ([#9](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/9), contributed by [@ismael9291](https://github.com/ismael9291))
- `limit` / `offset` / `search` pagination for `sonarr_get_series` and `radarr_get_movies` ([#9](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/9), contributed by [@ismael9291](https://github.com/ismael9291))

### Changed
- The server now starts in TRaSH-only mode even when no local *arr services are configured
- Queue responses now include pagination metadata (`total`, `returned`, `hasMore`, `nextOffset`, etc.)
- Refresh tool responses validate that the target exists before dispatching the command, and echo the resolved `id` / `title` / `year`
- README and server metadata updated to reflect remote MCP support and current versioning

### Fixed
- Broken README architecture image path
- Version drift between `package.json`, `server.json`, and runtime version metadata

### Removed
- Readarr (Books) support — replaced by Booklore + Shelfmark in Docker stack

## [1.5.4] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Duplicate tool registrations for `sonarr_get_quality_profiles`, `sonarr_get_root_folders`, `radarr_get_quality_profiles`, and `radarr_get_root_folders` — each was registered twice (via `addConfigTools()` and manually), causing 8 duplicate entries ([#6](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/issues/6), reported by [@a1ad](https://github.com/a1ad))
- Updated dependencies to fix 3 high severity vulnerabilities (hono, @hono/node-server, express-rate-limit)

## [1.5.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- `lidarr_search` now returns `artistName` and `disambiguation` instead of generic `title` field
- `lidarr_search` accepts `term`, `query`, `artist`, or `name` parameters with validation
- Fixed null safety on `overview` field truncation in Lidarr search results

Based on [PR #2](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/2) by [@bndlfm](https://github.com/bndlfm).
