## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Whisparr support.** Set `WHISPARR_URL` and `WHISPARR_API_KEY` and Whisparr joins `arr_status`, the unified `search`/`fetch` tools, `arr_search_all`, and the shared configuration review tools, alongside seven Whisparr-specific tools (`whisparr_get_library`, `whisparr_search`, `whisparr_get_scenes`, `whisparr_get_queue`, `whisparr_get_calendar`, `whisparr_search_item`, `whisparr_refresh_item`).

  Whisparr ships as two incompatible applications that both answer on `/api/v3`: V2 is a Sonarr fork (`/series`, `/episode`, `SeriesSearch`) and V3 "Eros" is a Radarr fork (`/movie`, `MoviesSearch`). Rather than asking operators to declare which they run, the client resolves it from `/system/status` on first use and caches it, so the same tool names work against either. Library items are sites on V2 and scenes on V3, and every response reports which variant answered. Anything not reporting a 2.x version is treated as Eros, so a future major keeps working without a code change.

  Whisparr only appears in the generic search tools when it is configured, so an operator who has not opted in never sees adult results.

- **Tools for recovering entries after `RemovedSeriesCheck` / `RemovedMovieCheck`.** `whisparr_check_folder` reports the media Whisparr can see in a folder, so a library row reporting zero files can be told apart from one whose files are silently untracked. `whisparr_delete_item` removes the row while always keeping files and never adding an import-list exclusion (neither is configurable: deleting files is wrong when only the metadata pointer broke, and the exclusion is keyed on the dead id so it protects nothing while blocking the replacement). `whisparr_add_item` takes a `path` so a live id can be attached to the folder that already holds the media, and `whisparr_rescan_item` re-reads the disk, which a metadata refresh does not do.
- **`{service}_get_remote_path_mappings` for Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr and Whisparr.** Mappings key on the download client's host *setting*, so renaming or moving a client orphans its mappings and every import fails while the app looks healthy elsewhere. The tool flags each mapping with whether its host still matches a configured download client rather than just listing them.

### Fixed
- **`radarr_delete_queue_item` always threw on success.** *arr DELETE endpoints answer with an empty body, which `response.json()` rejects, so the shared request path parsed a body that was not there. It now parses only when there is something to parse.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **Server no longer reports a stale version to clients.** `SERVER_VERSION` was hardcoded to `1.6.3` and had not been updated for three releases, so every client saw `1.6.3` in the `initialize` response regardless of the version actually running. It is now read from `package.json` at startup, which cannot drift. Falls back to `0.0.0-unknown` with a diagnostic on stderr if the file is unreadable, rather than failing startup.
- **`server.json` no longer drifts from the released version.** The MCP registry manifest was also stuck at `1.6.3`, in both its top-level `version` and its npm package entry. Because it is plain JSON it cannot read `package.json` at runtime, so it is now rewritten at bump time by `scripts/sync-server-json.mjs`, wired into the npm `version` lifecycle script. Running `npm version patch|minor|major` keeps the manifest in step automatically.

### Documentation
- Documented `sonarr_refresh_series` and `radarr_refresh_movie` in the README tool tables. Both shipped in 1.6.1 (via [#9](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/9)) but were never listed, leaving 43 of 45 tools documented.

### Security
- Bumped `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from 1.29.0 to **1.30.0** and refreshed `package-lock.json` to clear seven Dependabot advisories in transitive dependencies. All were pulled in via the SDK; none are direct dependencies of this project, and none are reachable from the code paths this server uses (it imports only `Server`, `StdioServerTransport` and `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`, and builds its own listener on `node:http`). The lockfile still matters because the Docker image installs with `npm ci`.
  - `fast-uri` 3.1.2 → **3.1.4** (via `ajv`) — host confusion via literal backslash authority delimiter (GHSA-v2hh-gcrm-f6hx, high) and via failed IDN canonicalization (GHSA-4c8g-83qw-93j6, high).
  - `hono` 4.12.26 → **4.12.32** — server-side XSS via JSX escaping bypass in `cx()` (GHSA-w62v-xxxg-mg59), `hono/jsx` cross-request context disclosure (GHSA-hvrm-45r6-mjfj), and API Gateway v1 adapter dropping a repeated request header during de-duplication (GHSA-xgm2-5f3f-mvvc). This server uses no JSX and no Lambda adapter.
  - `@hono/node-server` 1.19.14 → **2.0.12** — `serve-static` path traversal on Windows via encoded backslash `%5C` (GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9). Required the SDK bump: 1.29.0 pinned `^1.19.9`, which cannot reach the patched 2.0.5; 1.30.0 widens the range to `^1.19.9 || ^2.0.5`. This server does not use `serve-static`.
  - `body-parser` 2.2.2 → **2.3.0** (via `express`) — denial of service when an invalid limit value silently disables size enforcement (GHSA-v422-hmwv-36x6). This server does not use Express.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **HTTP transport no longer deadlocks behind a gateway/proxy** ([#22](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/22), by [@rwlove](https://github.com/rwlove); fixes [#21](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/issues/21)). The previous implementation shared a single module-level `Server` and serialized every request through a queue, because one `Server` can only be connected to one transport at a time. The moment a streamable-HTTP client (e.g. an MCP gateway/proxy such as n8n) opened its long-lived `GET` SSE stream, that request never completed and blocked the queue permanently — every subsequent `POST` (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, …) hung with no response. The transport now builds a **fresh `Server` + `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` per request** (the SDK's documented stateless pattern) and tears them down on response close, so a long-lived stream can no longer block other requests. The stdio transport is unchanged. Verified: with a GET stream held open, a concurrent POST went from timing out at 8 s to returning in ~2 ms.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-30

### Security
- Bumped `hono` from 4.12.22 to **4.12.26** ([#26](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/26)) to clear five advisories affecting `hono <= 4.12.24`: CORS middleware reflecting any origin with credentials (GHSA-88fw-hqm2-52qc), `serve-static` path traversal via encoded backslash on Windows (GHSA-wwfh-h76j-fc44), body-limit bypass on AWS Lambda (GHSA-rv63-4mwf-qqc2), and `Set-Cookie` / repeated-header dropping in the Lambda adapters (GHSA-j6c9-x7qj-28xf, GHSA-wgpf-jwqj-8h8p). Thanks to [@acesplit](https://github.com/acesplit) (#25) for the early report.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Radarr feature expansion** ([#12](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/12), by [@rappo](https://github.com/rappo)):
  - `radarr_update_movie` — update an existing movie's monitored state, quality profile, and other editable fields
  - `radarr_search_movies` — bulk-trigger searches across multiple movies at once
  - `radarr_delete_queue_item` — remove a stuck or unwanted item from the Radarr download queue
  - Quality-profile and quality fields surfaced on movie responses
- **Tag-triggered release pipeline** ([#20](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/20), based on [#11](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/11) by [@alejandrosnz](https://github.com/alejandrosnz)):
  - Multi-arch Docker images (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) built and pushed to **GHCR** on every `vX.Y.Z` tag, tagged `latest` / major / minor / exact
  - GitHub Release created automatically with notes pulled from this CHANGELOG
  - Hardened: every action pinned to a commit SHA, `workflow_dispatch` inputs passed via env vars, per-job least-privilege permissions, strict semver + package.json + CHANGELOG validation guards
  - **No npm publish and no stored `NPM_TOKEN`** — the pipeline uses only the per-run, auto-expiring `GITHUB_TOKEN`. npm publishing stays manual and passkey-gated.
- **`docker-compose.yml`** for self-hosters (n8n etc.) to run the server in HTTP mode in one command. Note: the compose HTTP endpoint is unauthenticated — intended for LAN / behind a reverse proxy only. Addresses the public-image request in [#5](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/issues/5).

## [1.6.5] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- HTTP transport now runs in **stateless mode** — a fresh `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` per request with no `Mcp-Session-Id` issued — fixing `400 Bad Request: Mcp-Session-Id header is required` for MCP clients that do not echo the session header back (notably **Claude Code**). The stateful implementation in 1.6.3/1.6.4 only worked for clients that round-tripped the session id. Request handling is serialized so the shared server is only ever connected to one transport at a time, and a fresh transport per request still sidesteps the SDK 1.27.x stateless-reuse guard. Added a regression test that exercises the no-session-header path. Thanks to [@jakefriz](https://github.com/jakefriz) (#15) and [@alejandrosnz](https://github.com/alejandrosnz) (#11) for independently identifying the stateless fix.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-06-10

### Security
- Bumped `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `^1.29.0` to clear transitive CVEs in nested dependencies

### Note
- Supersedes the never-published-to-npm 1.6.3 (which was tagged but not released); 1.6.4 includes all 1.6.3 changes plus the dependency security update.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- Fixed remote HTTP MCP mode failing after initialization with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.27.x by enabling stateful HTTP sessions with generated MCP session IDs (#5, reported by [@michaelheyman](https://github.com/michaelheyman))

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Upgraded `hono` and `path-to-regexp` to resolve 1 high and 2 moderate severity vulnerabilities (cookie name handling, path traversal in `toSSG`, static-serve middleware bypass, JSX SSR injection, IPv6 matching in `ipRestriction`, and ReDoS in `path-to-regexp`)

- `limit` / `offset` / `search` pagination for `sonarr_get_series` and `radarr_get_movies` ([#9](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/pull/9), contributed by [@ismael9291](https://github.com/ismael9291))

### Changed
- The server now starts in TRaSH-only mode even when no local *arr services are configured
- Queue responses now include pagination metadata (`total`, `returned`, `hasMore`, `nextOffset`, etc.)

## [1.5.4] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Duplicate tool registrations for `sonarr_get_quality_profiles`, `sonarr_get_root_folders`, `radarr_get_quality_profiles`, and `radarr_get_root_folders` — each was registered twice (via `addConfigTools()` and manually), causing 8 duplicate entries ([#6](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-arr/issues/6), reported by [@a1ad](https://github.com/a1ad))
- Updated dependencies to fix 3 high severity vulnerabilities (hono, @hono/node-server, express-rate-limit)

## [1.5.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- `lidarr_search` now returns `artistName` and `disambiguation` instead of generic `title` field
- `lidarr_search` accepts `term`, `query`, `artist`, or `name` parameters with validation
- Fixed null safety on `overview` field truncation in Lidarr search results
